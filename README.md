## Deployment Considerations

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Kubernetes cluster with minimum 3 worker nodes
- 16GB RAM and 4 vCPU per node for baseline performance
- Persistent storage: 500GB+ for databases and artifacts
- Load balancer with SSL termination capabilities
- Network policies for service isolation and security

**Environment Strategy:**
- Development: Local Docker Compose setup
- Staging: Single-cluster deployment with reduced resources
- Production: Multi-zone Kubernetes deployment with high availability
- Disaster Recovery: Cross-region backup and replication

**Monitoring and Observability:**
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) integration
- Centralized logging with ELK/EFK stack
- Alerting rules for system health and performance thresholds
- Distributed tracing for microservices communication
- Custom metrics for test execution and platform usage

**Security Measures:**
- Network segmentation with service mesh (Istio)
- Secrets management using Kubernetes secrets/Vault
- Regular security scanning of container images
- API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging for compliance requirements

**Scalability Configuration:**
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for dynamic resource allocation
- Database read replicas for improved performance
- CDN integration for static asset delivery
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Queue-based architecture for handling traffic spikes
